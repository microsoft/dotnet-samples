// Until Windows 8, kernel events can only be turned on in a session called 'NT Kernel Logger' and no
// other providers except the kernel provider can be in such a session.   Thus if you wish a trace 
// that has both kernel and non-kernel events you must have two session.   In the code below we show
// how to do this in the real time case.    Basically you simply have two session, one for the
// kernel events and one for everything else.  
//
// This requires the program to be multi-threaded, since there needs to be a thread to listen for
// each session.   This is the main complication of doing this.
//
// Note also that since each session's 'flushing schedule' will be different the events from the
// two session will be NOT necessarily serviced in chronological order (all users events and all
// kernel events will come in order, but user and kernel events may not be in order).  
//
// As mentioned on Windows 8 you can use a single session and thus avoid these complexities.  In addition
// event before Windows 8 there are a number of kernel events that are available as non-kernel 
// providers.   Do a 
//             logman query providers
// To see all providers that the OS provides, and look for ones with the Microsoft-Windows-Kernel prefix.
// While these providers have 'Kernel' in their name they are not subject to the restrictions mentioned
// above, and thus can be used with other user-mode providers.   In particular the Microsoft-Windows-Kernel-Process
// provider can give you the process, thread, and image load events which are some of the most likely
// kernel events you may want.
