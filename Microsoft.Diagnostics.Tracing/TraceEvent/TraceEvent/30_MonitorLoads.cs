// <summary>
// MonitorModuleLoads is a simple application that uses the TraceEvent library to print ever time any
// process starts or stops as well as any DLL that is loaded in any process.   This illustrates very
// basic event processing of OS Kernel events using the TraceEvent library.  
// 
// The basic flow of the program is
//     * Create a 'real time' TraceEventSession.  This lets you control what events you wish to collect
//     * Enable the events of interest (in this case process and image load events).  Because these are 
//          kernel events you must use EnableKernelProvider rather then EnableProvider.  
//     * Connect a ETWTraceEventSource for the session, An TraceEventSource represents the stream of events
//     * Connect a TraceEventParser to the source.    Parsers know how to interpret events from particular 
//          ETW providers.  In this case we care about Kernel events so we get the KernelTraceEventParser
//     * Attach callbacks to the Parser for the events you are interested in.  These callback get events
//          that are nicely parsed into intellisense-friendly properties. 
//     * Call the ETWTraceEventSource.Process() method, which waits for events and sends them to the callbacks. 
//     
// After 'Process()' is called, it will return if
//     * ETWTraceEventSource.StopProcessing() is called.
//     * The TraceEventSession.Dispose() is called.

                //
                // To help avoid this by default TraceEventSession sets 'StopOnDispose' so that it will stop
                // the ETW session if the TraceEventSession dies.   Thus executions that 'clean up' the TraceEventSession
                // will clean up the ETW session.   This covers many cases (including throwing exceptions)
