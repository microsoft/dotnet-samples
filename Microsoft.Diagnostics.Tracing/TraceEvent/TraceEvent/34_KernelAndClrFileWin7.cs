// Until Windows 8, kernel events can only be turned on in a session called 'NT Kernel Logger' and no
// other providers except the kernel provider can be in such a session.   Thus if you wish a trace 
// that has both kernel and non-kernel events you must have two session.   In the code below we show
// how to do this in the file case.    Basically you simply have two session, one for the
// kernel events and one for everything else.   This means that you generate to files, one for 
// kernel events and one for everything else (in our case the CLR events).  You then can 'merge'
// the files as a post-processing step.    
//
// As mentioned on Windows 8 you can use a single session and thus avoid these complexities.  In addition
// event before Windows 8 there are a number of kernel events that are available as non-kernel 
// providers.   Do a 
//             logman query providers
// To see all providers that the OS provides, and look for ones with the Microsoft-Windows-Kernel prefix.
// While these providers have 'Kernel' in their name they are not subject to the restrictions mentioned
// above, and thus can be used with other user-mode providers.   In particular the Microsoft-Windows-Kernel-Process
// provider can give you the process, thread, and image load events which are some of the most likely
// kernel events you may want.
